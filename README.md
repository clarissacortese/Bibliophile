# ProgettoJavaScriptAdvanced

The project here presented is an application, developed through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap 5.2 for building the interface. It does not require installation, just access the link and can be used directly from the browser.

The purpose of this application is to encourage reading: the user types in the literary genre he or she is looking for, and the application returns a list of authors and titles. By clicking on the desired title or author, the user can read the description of the book.

It uses the API from the following URL: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

The link to access it is the following: https://clarissacortese.github.io/ProgettoJavaScriptAdvanced/
